When you think you’ve been charging your phone for the last 3 hours but it wasn’t plugged in
When you say bye to someone then both walk the same direction
The face you make while helping your son look for his Halloween candy you ate last night
When you open a bag of chips and there’s only like 5 and a half chips inside
When you sneeze in public during the pandemic
When your parents say you spend too much time on your phone
When you walk into someone’s home and they have a “Live, Laugh, Love” sign on the wall
Mondays got me like
If I won the lottery
When you see a dog outside
Why I didn’t respond to your email
If I didn’t work here I’d work
